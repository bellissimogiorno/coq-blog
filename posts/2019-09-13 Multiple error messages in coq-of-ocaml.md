The [coq-of-ocaml](https://github.com/clarus/coq-of-ocaml) compiler transforms [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) programs to [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) ones. There usually are many errors in each file to import (the Coq language tends to be stricter than OCaml and we do not want to import code with too much encoding). Fixing errors may be the most time consuming part of the import. We present a system to display all the errors at once instead of one by one. We believe that it helps to get a quick idea of how difficult a file is to translate, while having a sense of progress while fixing errors.
